# AOS Device App SDK Sample Application


## Quick Start Guide ##

### 1. Install the SDK.

Download the SDK installer and run it.  It will prompt you for an install location.

```sh
aos SDK installer version v6.9.2
==========================================
Enter target directory for SDK (default: /usr/local/aos-esr1k-x86_64):
```

Here's a complete example of installing the SDK under /opt/tools:

```sh
$ ./aos-esr1k-toolchain-v6.9.2.sh
aos SDK installer version v6.9.2
=====================================
Enter target directory for SDK (default: /usr/local/aos-esr1k-x86_64): /opt/tools/aos-esr1k-x86_64
You are about to install the SDK to "/opt/tools/aos-esr1k-x86_64". Proceed[Y/n]? <Enter>
Extracting SDK......................done
Setting it up...done
SDK has been successfully set up and is ready to be used.
Each time you wish to use the SDK in a new shell session, you need to source the environment setup script e.g.
$ . /opt/tools/aos-esr1k-x86_64/environment-setup-armv7a-vfp-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi
```

### 2. Clone the sample app from [github](https://github.com/aetheros/aos-metering-app.git).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aetheros/aos-metering-app.git
cd aos-metering-app
```

### 3. Build the sample app using the SDK toolchain.

SDK versions 6.9.2 and above provide a `aossdkshell` script which will create a development shell,
in which the shell environment is set up for using the SDK toolchain.
It will change the shell prompt to make it clear to the user that the SDK environment is sourced,
meaning it is configured for cross compilation, and SDK tools are in the default PATH.
You can exit out of the development shell with the `exit` command.
```sh
$ /opt/tools/aos-esr1k-x86_64/aossdkshell
{aossdk} $
```

Alternatively, source the environment file as indicated at SDK installation. It will set the environment
in the current shell for using the SDK tools and cross compilation.
```sh
. /opt/tools/aos-esr1k-x86_64/environment-setup-armv7a-vfp-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi
```

Run `make` to build the app.

Once the app is built, several SDK tools can be used for app testing and packaging:

- `aosapp` - Install, Uninstall, Activate, and Deactivate the app on a connected development device.
- `aospkg` - Create an unsigned AOS package.
- `aoscsr` - Perform a Certificate Signing Request to create a key/certificate pair for code signing.
- `aossignpkg` - Create a signed AOS package using the certificate/key pair generated by `aoscsr`.

### 4. Install the app on a device and activate it.

Connect a device to your host via USB.  Make sure you have the `adb` command installed.  On Ubuntu, it is in the **android-tools-adb** package.

Use the **aosapp** command to install and activate the app.  Run `aosapp install` to install the app on the connected device.  Use the `-s <serialno>` option if there are multiple devices connected. If the application installs successfully, it can then be activated with `aosapp activate`.

Run `aosapp -h` to see the list of options.

## Common commands ##

### Starting and stopping the app ###

Use **aosapp** to control whether the app is activated on the device, meaning it will run automatically.

- `aosapp activate` - Enable the app so it is always running.
- `aosapp deactivate` - Disable the app so it does not run.

To simply stop, start, or restart an app, use **prctl** from a device shell.

- `prctl stop <appname>` - Stop the app
- `prctl start <appname>` - Start the app
- `prctl restart <appname>` - Restart the app
- `prctl status <appname>` - Check the status of the app

```sh
/ $ prctl stop aos_metering_app
aos_metering_app   stopping     [ok]
/ $
/ $ prctl start aos_metering_app
aos_metering_app   running      [ok] (last killed by signal: 9)
/ $
/ $ prctl restart aos_metering_app
aos_metering_app   want-running [ok] (last killed by signal: 9)
/ $
/ $ prctl status aos_metering_app
aos_metering_app   running      [ok] (last killed by signal: 9)
```

When stopping the app, if it does not exit in response to a SIGTERM sent by the supervisor process, it will be terminated after a few seconds with SIGKILL (9).  **prctl** reports this fact in the status as "(last killed by signal: 9)".

### Updating the app ###

Until further notice, the app can only be updated by first uninstalling it, and then installing the new version.

```sh
aosapp uninstall
aosapp install
aosapp activate
```

### Accessing a device shell ###

Use the **adb** command to access a device.  Running `adb shell` will drop you into a shell as the **apps** user.  Common linux commands can be run from this shell.

If multiple devices are attached, use the `-s` option to select a device by its serial number.  `adb devices` will list all the connected devices.

If you specify a command and arguments after `adb shell`, adb will run that command in a shell.
 
Example:
```sh
$ adb shell cat /etc/issue
aos esr1k-lgausmeter 6.0.6g 6.0.6-R-20210506:061638-g55dc5d7
$
```

### Reading the log ###

From a device shell, use the **logread** command to read the system log.  Use **grep** for filtering.

Example:
```sh
$ adb shell logread |grep aos_metering |tail -n 10

$
```

### Accessing the application environment. ###

Running `aosapp shell` will open a shell in an environment identically to the one the application runs in.

Example:
```sh
 aosapp -s 87e76c0 shell
/home/apps # ls -l
ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x    1 aos      root        193456 May 14 03:15 aos_metering_app
-rw-r-----    1 root     root           165 May 14 03:16 app_config.json
-rw-r--r--    1 aos      root           146 May 14 03:15 env

-rw-r--r--    1 aos      root           138 May 14 03:15 service.conf
